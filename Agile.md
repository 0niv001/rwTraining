Can Agile actually be scaled??
Comes from parallel innovation (Scrum, XP)

**Limiting works in progress**
- Software > Docs
- Apply time limits (Scrum) || Limit the amount of work in progress (Kanban). 
- Allows for more frequent learning, less redundant projects.

**Collaboration**
- Social dimension
- Cross-functional teams (Team with all different skills needed, not niche)
- Product trio (Dev, Designer, Product Manager)
- Roles and responsibilities can get muddled up. 

**Refinement**
- Make responding to change as part of your plan. 

**Principles, Practices and Outcomes**
- Keep everything aligned. 
- Make sure everything is working - question and evaluate practices. 
- What are you doing? Why are you doing it? What do you want to achieve? is it working?

**Practices**
- Sprints and iterations - Cycle of finishing and releasing work as things are completed. 
- Standup and Status Meetings - What did you do yesterday? will do today? What is blocking your progress?
- Retrospectives - Evaluation of what went well, and what could be improved.
