*Software Development lifecycle*

Steps
1. Feasibility study (Can it be built)
2. Requirements analysis ()
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Testing
6. Deployment
7. Maintenance

Methodology for software development. 
Follows steps to ensure success of the project. 

Aims to quickly and efficiently make high quality software. 

**Feasibility study**
- How development is initiated when a need or opportunity is identified
- Purpose and main activities of a feasibility study. 
- Importance of planning software development
- Purpose of business case
- Benefits from using operational software
- Short focused study
	- Does it contribute to objectives
	- Can it be implemented within time and budget constraints
	- Can it be integrated with other systems
- You either can and cannot do it
- Provides documentation that the idea was investigated. 
- What is the likelihood that this is calm to do. 

We will be doing this for our final project. 

Come up with 3 ideas of what you want to build and sketch out technical feasibility, and once you pick something, you will do the full feasibility study. 

What problem do you want to solve?
1. Browser - Vertical Tabs, No fingerprinting, WebKit, FS view, minimal, no sign in and tracking. 
2. Something related to Music / DJ?
3. Something related to Cybersec?

*Technical feasibility*
- Do you have the resources and tech to accomplish the task. 
- Is the technology stable and established. 
- Need to be able to manage risks. 

*Financial*
- Cost benefit analysis. 
- What the cost is likely to be later on due to different factors. 
- Put time into your cost analysis. 

*Collection of info*
- Set collection goals early. 
- Well defined metrics and models - Keep them consistent
- Can have big time costs

*Risk assessment*
- Read dissertation back. 

*Consider Alternatives*
- Market positioning
- USP 
- What are the alternatives available. 
- External sources - Careful with dependencies. 

*Operational*
- Performace
- Information
- Economy
- Control
- Efficiency
- Services

*Environmental

*Legal feasibility*
- Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988

**Report Writing
- Intro / Executive Summary
- Background - Give it some life
- Outline of project
- Methodology / Method analysis
- Overview of alternatives
- Conclusion
- Recommendations

Friday 29th EOD - Have feasibility report for the 3 ideas?
