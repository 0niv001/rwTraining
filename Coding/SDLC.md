*Software Development lifecycle*
- Methodology for software development. 
- Aims to quickly and efficiently make high quality software. 

Steps
1. Feasibility study (Can it be built)
2. Requirements analysis ()
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Testing
6. Deployment
7. Maintenance

## Feasibility study
- How development is initiated when a need or opportunity is identified
- Purpose and main activities of a feasibility study. 
- Importance of planning software development
- Purpose of business case
- Benefits from using operational software
- Short focused study
	- Does it contribute to objectives
	- Can it be implemented within time and budget constraints
	- Can it be integrated with other systems
- You either can and cannot do it
- Provides documentation that the idea was investigated. 
- What is the likelihood that this is calm to do. 

*Technical feasibility*
- Do you have the resources and tech to accomplish the task. 
- Is the technology stable and established. 
- Need to be able to manage risks. 

*Financial*
- Cost benefit analysis. 
- What the cost is likely to be later on due to different factors. 
- Put time into your cost analysis. 

*Collection of info*
- Set collection goals early. 
- Well defined metrics and models - Keep them consistent
- Can have big time costs

*Risk assessment

*Consider Alternatives*
- Market positioning
- USP 
- What are the alternatives available. 
- External sources - Careful with dependencies. 

*Operational*
- Performance
- Information
- Economy
- Control
- Efficiency
- Services

*Environmental*

*Legal feasibility*
- Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988

**Report Writing**
- Intro / Executive Summary
- Background - Give it some life
- Outline of project
- Methodology / Method analysis
- Overview of alternatives
- Conclusion
- Recommendations
## Requirements
- Requirements help communicate and define customer needs and problems
- Stakeholders can establish consensus on what problems need to be solved. 
- Helps give estimate for timelines. 

**How research can help understand end users**
- Who they are
- Problem they face

**Personas**
Characters created from research to represent different users.   
Helps understand user needs and behaviours. 
Helps you get a different perspective. 

**Customer Journey Mapping**
- Visual representation of experience customers have
- Steps
	1. Nail down user persona
	2. Understand who customers are
	3. Understand goals
	4. Map out user touch points
	5. identify pain points
	6. Prioritise and fix roadblocks
	7. Update and improve. 

**Functional requirements**
- Requirements representing core functionality of system. 

**Non-Functional requirements**
- Additional requirement e.g. Time and performance constraints. 
- Security
	- Ongoing process, ensuring [[CIA]]
	- Software needs to be developed with security in mind. 
	- Should be planned and managed throughout SDLC process. 
	- Need more than tech to ensure security. 
- Availability
	- Timely and reliable access to info and ability of use. 
- Reliability
	- Does it do what it's meant to do?
	- Does not account for repairs that might take place. 
	- Accounts for time taken for components to fail whilst in operation. 
- Performance
	- What the system does and how well it needs to do it. 
	- Should be determined as result of functional analysis looking at customer needs. 
- Capacity
	- Measurable property of a process to the spec. 
		- Number of stories - Future vs past
		- Number of sprints - Future vs past
- Continuity
	- What's needed to keep operations going. 
	- Collect info on resources needed to support organisation. 
	- How long will the software run without crashing?
- Supportability
	- Support software over its lifecycle at reasonable cost. 
	- Have a wiki in place for final project!!
- Serviceability
	- How easily systems can be maintained and repaired. 
	- Early detection of problems is critical. 
- Scalability
	- Can you keep up with volume of demand?
	- Physical - Hardware, data storage, network bandwidth.
	- Intangible - Business growth, can be intrinsic and extrinsic.

**Good requirements**
- Unambiguous
- Testable
- Clear
- Feasible
- Independent
- Atomic - Single thing. 
- Necessary

**Data Dictionary**
- Allows for research to be repeated easily by allowing others to understand data. 
- Explain what all the vars and vals mean. 
- Things to include:
	- Var names
	- Measurement units
	- Allowed values
	- Definition of vars. 

**Tools for requirements gathering**
- Functional decomposition
	- Break down problem in simpler subtasks. 
	- Functional requirement doc is a txt representation of functional decomposition. 
- Use case diagram
	- Dynamic or behaviour diagram in UML
	- Model functionality of system using actors and use cases. 
- Context diagram
- UML
	- 14 Diagram types representing structure, behaviour and interaction of system.
	- ERD 
	- Sequence
	- Activity diagram - Dynamic aspect of systems. 


!! Most important part of the requirements is the contract - Makes sure you get paid and all parties agree on the requirements for the software.
