*Reflection - Kinda redundant* 
Examines and modifies class info and instances at runtime, allowing for dynamic class creation, method invocation and inspection of class fields and methods. 

*Annotations - Have a look at this*
Metadata to code processed at compile or run time. 
Helps optimise and streamline code execution. 
Method contracts - Used to add info about method contracts
Optimisations - Specify optimisations like caching and memoisation. 

*Java performance tuning*
- Understand performance bottlenecks. 
- CPU-bound Operations. 
- I/O - Bound Operations. 
- Memory usage issues - Think of stack and heap. 

*Optimisation Techniques*
- Algorithmic improvements
- Data structure changes
- Caching (L1,L2) to improve performance once bottlenecks are identified. 

*Tools for profiling and tuning*
- JConsole
- VisualVM
- Mission Control

## Best practices

**Code readability and maintainability**
- Descriptive variable names. 
- Clear comments. 
- Avoid code duplication.
- Avoid global variables. 

**Exception handling**
- Choose appropriate level of abstraction. 
- Use specific exception types and logging exceptions. 
- Build apps that can filter exceptions for you. 

**Effective use of design patterns**
- Proven solutions to common problems. 
- Fit the problem at hand, tweak them as necessary.  
- Avoid overuse - Make things as efficient as possible. 
- Think of the tradeoffs. 

## Updates in Java 23

**Improved garbage collection**
Better performance and memory footprint 

**Enhanced JIT compilation**
Better code optimisation and runtime performance 

**Improved Security**
Better protection against common cyber attacks and vulnerabilities

**Refined JPMS**
Better scalability and maintainability of large scale applications. 

**Migration Considerations**
- Compatibility issues
- Tools and infrastructure compatibility
