**[[IP]]**
**[[OSI Model]]**
**[[Ports and Protocols]]
[[Ethernet]]

### Network Security
**Type of network attacks:**
1. Bugging / Interception:
	- Attacks observe data on network to gain info for next attack. 
	- Passive attack where comms go on as normal - Wiretapping. 
	- [[Encryption]] is a strong counter for it. 
2. [[Alteration]]
3. [[DoS]]

**Protection:**
- **[[Firewall]]**
- **[[IDS]]**
- **[[IPS]]**
- **[[VPN]]**
- **[[Antivirus]]**

**Network Design:**
Used to satisfy data comms requirements whilst having efficient performance. 
**[[Segmentation]]**
- *[[DMZ]]*
- *[[VLAN]]*
- *[[VPN]]*
- [[Defence in Depth]]
- [[NAC]]
- [[Zero Trust]]
