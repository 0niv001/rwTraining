# Data
- Data can be stored in different formats, with various encodings e.g. ASCII, UCS, UTF-8. 
- Data is often created for 3 reasons: Backup, Input and Consumption. 

**Types of data:
- [[Structured data]]
- [[Unstructured data]]
- [[Semi-structured data]]

**Types of databases:
- [[Relational database]]
- [[Document oriented database]]
- [[Object oriented database]]

**Data Manipulation** - Shaping the data to answer question. 
- *Hierarchical indexing:*
	- Grouping data into parents and child groups. 
	- Partial indexing allows to select subsets of data. 
- *Merging datasets:*  Allows us to find useful patterns.
- *Pivoting*: Reshaping data to examine from different perspectives. 

**Data Cleaning** - Choose which parts of the data are relevant. 
- *Remove missing and duplicates:* Analyse missing data to find collection problems. 
- *Replace values:* Fill values with NaN or 0 (constants) to avoid errors and bugs. 
- *Rename axis:* Use map and rename. 
- *Remove outliers*: Make use of array operations. 

**Data analysis:**
- Split data into groups
- Apply calculations
- Combine results.
