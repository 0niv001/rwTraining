*Trust no one, verify everything* - Assume everything is on an open and untrusted network.

Encapsulate info assets and services applied to them. 

Recognition of unlimited capabilities once someone is in the system. 

Evolving design approach, that adds defence at all levels

Microsegmentation adds internal perimeters, zero trust puts focus on assets instead of the perimeter. 

Use MFA and only allow access to specific apps and data that they need.

**Guiding principles**
1. Verify explicitly: always authenticate and authorised based on data points like ID, location and device. 
2. [[Least privilege]]: Users should have just enough access and just in time access - Only what they need, when they need it.
3. Assume breach: Segment access by network, users and use encryption to protect data and use analytics to get visibility and detect threats. 
**Foundational pillars**
1. Identities: When ID wants to access a resource it needs to be authenticated and follow least privilege.
2. Devices: They need to be monitored for health and compliance. 
3. Apps: Need to know of all the shadow IT used, also looking at permission and access.
4. Data: Classified, labelled and encrypted based on attributes.
5. Infrastructure: Assess for version, configuration and JIT access. 
6. Networks: Should be segmented e.g. [[Firewall]], encrypted E2E, and monitored.
