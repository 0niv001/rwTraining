*Role Based Access Control*

Sets up user permissions based on role.

These often work in a hierarchical manner, where senior role has all the permissions of the roles below it.

Works well with similar access requirement, or high turnover places.

In the workplace monitoring role based permissions is very important to avoid privilege creep.
