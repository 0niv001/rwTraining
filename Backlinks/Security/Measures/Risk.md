Intersection between vulnerabilities and threats, that might affect assets. 

When looking at vulnerability, we first look at the likelihood and impact of an exploit. 
Once risk have been identified, we need to prioritise certain risks and analyse them. 

Again we can prioritise them using a probability and likelihood matrix. 

**Risk treatment
1. Retention: Do nothing and accept it, low impact and probability 
2. Modification: Reduce impact and likelihood, most common. 
4. Avoidance: Stop doing what causes the risk, high impact and probability
5. Sharing: Outsource risk - insurance.
