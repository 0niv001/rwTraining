Allowing only minimum access needed for user to fullfill function. 

**Privileged access management**
Role based and privileges that become active in real time when they are needed instead of having them on at all times. 

**Privileged accounts**
Accounts with permissions beyond normal users e.g help desk, admins. 
Because of higher access we require more detailed logging and auditing. 

**Segregation of duties**
No one should control entire high risk transaction from start to finish. 
This allows us to prevent fraud and and detect errors.
