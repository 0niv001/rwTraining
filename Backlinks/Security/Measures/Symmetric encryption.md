- Uses the same key in encryption and decryption process. 
- Mostly used for encrypting messages and bulk data. 
- Less expensive and more efficient than [[Asymmetric encryption]]

*Issues:
- Everyone that knows the key can access. 
- Distribution of the key is difficult, cant use the same channel. 
- Each individual needs a different key - scalability issues.
