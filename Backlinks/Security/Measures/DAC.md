*Discretionary Access Control*

Type of [[Access Control]] enforced on all subjects and objects in a system. 

Owner of the object decides which subjects should have access to the objects and what those rights should be. This method however is not very scalable. 

Most information systems use DAC, where user with access can share it or pass it on to someone else. Which then gives almost the same level of access as the original owner. 

[[RBAC]] is usually a form of DAC. 

DAC does not prevent subjects from causing harm, eg. it would allow [[Trojan]]to run.
