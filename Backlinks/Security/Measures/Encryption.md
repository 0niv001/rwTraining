Protecting data, by using Cryptography, turning plaintext into cipher text.

Can also provide integrity by using digital signatures. 

Encryption comes into play once attacker already has access to info. 

The main point of encryption is to not make it worth the time and effort to decrypt the data if it is stolen. Doesn't prevent access, but rather increases costs. 

Good encryption should also provide with non repudiation which guarantees that what is received is what was sent. 

There are different types of encryption, with the most used being:
1. [[Asymmetric encryption]]
2. [[Symmetric encryption]]
3. [[Hashing]]
