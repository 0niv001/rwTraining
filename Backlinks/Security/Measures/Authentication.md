AuthZ: What you are allowed to do with your level of access. 

2 Main methods of authN:
1. SFA - uses only one method
2. MFA - uses 2 or more methods 

**Authentication methods.
- [[Passwords]]
- SSO - Sign in one time and use credentials for different resources.
- MFA - Increases security by using a different method of authentication (have, know, are)
