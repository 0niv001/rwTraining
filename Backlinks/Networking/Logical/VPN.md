Comms tunnel that gives Point2Point and secure connection over untrusted networks, often used to access company networks. 

VPN makes local host part of the remote network by using WAN link that connects you to the remote LAN, making the host appear as though it is local on the remote network, meaning that it has access to the remote LAN and itâ€™s access is secure.

**Types of VPNs:**
1. *Client to site:* Allows remote uses to securely access corporate network when and where needed.
2. *Host to host:* Endpoints of the tunnel are 2 individual hosts, so all traffic is protected.
3. *Site to site:* Allows connection from remote sites to the corporate backbone securely over public medium, instead of needing more expensive WANs.
4. *Extranet:* Allow partners and customers to be connected to the corporate network in a limited way for B2B comms.
