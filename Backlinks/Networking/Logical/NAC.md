Controlling access to environment through compliance and implementation of security policies

Network is one of the most critical assets, so we need to know and control access to it

IoT includes HVAC systems, security systems and even vending machines

Organisation access control policies should be enforced via NAC devices

NAC devices provide network visibility needed for access security and could potentially be used for incident response

Can also provide isolation for non compliant devices in a quarantined network, and give a way to fix these.

The goal is to make sure that all the devices joining the network do so once they comply with the policies set out

Some use cases include:
- Medical devices
- IoT
- BYOD
- Guest users and contractors
