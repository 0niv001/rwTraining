*Open System Interconnection*
Framework used to understand how communication works between systems. 

OSI Model is made up of 7 Different Layers:
1. Physical - Cables. 
2. [[Link Layer]]
3. [[Network Layer]]
4. [[Transport Layer]]
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. [[Application Layer]]

**Encapsulation**
Adding meta-data (headers) to data, so that it can be received by other layers and be used,

As data goes through, each layer adds encapsulation, and on the other end the data is de-capsulated, so that it can be used.

The headers and footers are used to interpret the data payload, and then they are discarded.
