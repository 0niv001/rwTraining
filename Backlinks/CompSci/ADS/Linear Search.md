Go through each item in array and check if it is that one, very Inefficient for large lists. 

**Steps**
1. Identify search term - What you want to find. 
2. Look at the first item on the list. 
3. Compare item with search term. 
4. If they are the same search is over, if not go to the next item in the list. 
5. If you reach the end without a match, the term is not in this list and the search will stop.
