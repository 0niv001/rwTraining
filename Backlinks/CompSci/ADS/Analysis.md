- The running time of an algo is the number of primitive operations executed.
- We assume that every line takes a constant amount of time
- When a for or while loop exits, the test is executed one more time than the loop body
- The running time of the algo is the sum of running times for each statement executed
- We can express running time as a*n+b* for constants a and b
- The average case is often roughly as bad as the worst case
