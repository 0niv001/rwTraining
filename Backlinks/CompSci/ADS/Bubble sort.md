Pass - Each run through the list. 
Very inefficient, super slow. 

**Steps**
1. Look at first number in list
2. Compare with next number
3. Is number smaller? if so, swap them around, if not don't
4. Move to next number along in the list and make that the current number
5. Repeat until the last number in the list has been reached. 
6. When end is reached without any stops, list is ordered and algo can stop. 

! have a swap counter.
