- Sorts n real numbers in an array in place, thus using less memory. 
- Running time of $O(n^2)$, making it efficient for small input sizes. 
- Uses an incremental approach. 
- Better than [[Bubble sort]]

**Steps**
1. Start with second value in list, if its smaller than the one on the left swap. 
2. Move left and repeat. 
3. Continue until end of the list is reached.
