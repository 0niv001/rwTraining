Follows divide and conquer approach - break down problem in smaller bits, solves them recursively then combines the solution. 

Lower running time than incremental approaches such as [[Insertion sort]]


2. Conquer the problems by solving them recursively. 
3. Combine solution of subproblem into original problem one
4. Recursion stops when the sequence has a length of 1. 

**Steps**
Repeatedly divide a list in two until all elements are separated individually. 

Pairs of elements are compared, placed into order and combined. 

Process repeats until list is recompiled. 

Recursion stops when the sequence has a length of 1.
