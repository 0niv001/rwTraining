Knowledge based agents use reasoning over a representation of knowledge to decide which actions to take. 

Logic is a general class of representations to support knowledge based agents. 

Knowledge base are set of sentences, which are in turn expressed in knowledge representation languages. 

Inferences need to obey the requirement that when you ask a question of the knowledge base, the answer follows from what has been Tell to the KB beforehand.

KS agent can be built by simply telling it what it needs to know, with one sentence at the time, until the agent knows how to operate in its environment ⇒ Declarative approach.

Another way is to encode desired behaviours directly as the program code ⇒ Procedural approach.

A combination of both should be used to create a successful agent.

We can also give KB agents mechanisms to learn for itself, making it fully autonomous.

There are two main types of logic:
1. [[Propositional Logic]]
2. [[First Order Logic]]
