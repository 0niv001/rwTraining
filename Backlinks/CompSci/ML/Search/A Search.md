Key points

- Evaluation function used by A* Search called the f-cost
- Admissibility of a heuristic
- Consistency of a heuristic

Most common informed search algorithms.

g(n) is the path cost from the initial state to node n, and h(n) is the estimated cost of the shortest path from n to a goal state.

A* is cost-optimal depending on certain properties:

- Admissibility
    - Admissible: never overestimates the cost to read ac goal - optimistic
- Consistency
    
    - h(n) is consistent, if for every node n and every successor n’ of n generated by an action a, we have:
    
h(n)≤ c(n, a, n’) + h(n’)

If heuristic has some simple properties, A* Search is guaranteed to find an optimal solution.

In contrast to greedy best first, A* takes into account the cost of reaching a state from the initial state, as well as the heuristic

Some benefits of A*:

- It’s complete - Always finds a solution if there is one
- It’s optimal - Finds the optimal solution first
- It’s optimally efficient - No other optimal algorithm, can guarantee to expand fewer nodes than A*

Disadvantages of A*:

- Holds a large number of nodes in memory at any given time
    - Whenever it expands a node with an f-cost of C, all the nodes with f-cost < C must already be stored in memory.
    - Contours: boundaries in the state space that contain all states with f-cost < or = to contour value.

Research has focused on reducing the memory usage of A*, and it’s been successful, but there is a trade off between memory usage and run time.
