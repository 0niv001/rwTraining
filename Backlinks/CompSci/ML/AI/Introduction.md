The learning part of ML is based on 3 main concepts:
1. Model - this is what makes the predictions and discovers the patterns
2. Data
	- Key part of ML
	- Features are values that models use to predict the labels. 
	- Look at size and diversity of data - range and lots of it. 
3. Training
	- Model will find best solution comparing predicted with actual values. 
	- Difference between the values is the [[Loss]]. 
	- Calculations will then be adjusted to reduce loss. 

There are different types of machine learning, the main 3 types are:
1. [[Supervised Learning]]
2. [[Unsupervised Learning]]
3. [[Reinforcement Learning]]


> [!NOTE] Value alignment problem
> We need to program objectives that are aligned with what humans actually want, Systems with incorrect objectives will have negative consequences we cannot anticipate.
