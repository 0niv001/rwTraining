Store data as objects, like in OOP, which allows them to have methods. 

Instead of using rows and columns, it makes use of complex data structures for data representation. 

Very flexible for dealing with complex types and relationships, without the need to many tables and joins. 

Well suited for:
- Multimedia content (Storage and retrieval of images, vids and audio). 
- Engineering designs 
- Scientific simulations (Manage large datasets with complex relationships)
- Telecom (Managing Network config)

**Inheritance**
- Allows new class to get attributes and methods of an existing class. 
- Allows for code re-use and hierarchical organisation of classes. 
- Easier to manage and extend DB schema. 

**Polymorphisms**
- Treat different objects as instance of the same class. 
- Can use single method across objects of the same class. 
- Reduces need for separate methods.
