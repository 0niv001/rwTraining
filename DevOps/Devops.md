**Stages**
- Plan
	- Everything before any code is written. 
	- Helps organise resources and priorities. 
- Create
	- First stage of CI/CD pipeline. 
	- Where code is designed and developed using VC. 
	- Key to improve velocity. 
- Verify
	- Confirm quality of the code. 
	- Instant insight into every commit. 
	- Find and fix flaws as development goes along. 
- Package
	- After code is created 
	- Package apps and dependencies, managing containers. 
	- Maintain a consistent software supply chain. 
- Release / Deployment 
	- Push code updates into prod. 
	- Releases can be deployed as iterations are created, tested and ready
- Configure
	- Set up, management and maintenance of app env. 
	- Automated config handles complex env across servers, networks and storage systems. 
- Monitoring
	- Automated part of process. 
	- Track software and infrastructures. 
	- Increase security, reliability and agility. 
- Manage
	- Visibility and control across E2E [[SDLC]]

**Tools?**
- Source code management - Git. 
	- Sharing code repos. 
	- Modified code is validated and approved via SCM. 
	- Multiple devs can work on a single project. 
- CI
	- Iteration process about efficiency. 
	- Automating manual tasks and testing results in faster iteration. 
	- Identify and fix problems easily. 
	- Less context switching. 
- CD
	- Automate release process. 
	- Follows CI.
